# Face-Expression-Challenge
An emotion recognition based game

#Before you start
In order to use Face Expression Challenge you must own a key for the Microsoft's Emotion API.

If you don't have one, you can visit
<a  href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a> and sign in either
with your Microsoft account or GitHub or LinkedIn. After signing in a page showing your current subscription will appear. 
Click on Request new trials, check the Emotion-Preview box and "I agree..." one in the bottom and then click Subscribe. 
Finally copy the Emotion - Preview Key 1 (Key 2 will work too) and paste it in the MainPage.xaml.cs file as the value of 
the "subscriptionKey" string variable.

If you already have a key for the Emotion API you can directly paste it in the MainPage.xaml.cs file as the value of 
the "subscriptionKey" string variable.
